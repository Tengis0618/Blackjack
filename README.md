# Blackjack

A two-player (user vs computer) client-side card game (there is a server component for an API for the last part). The card game will be a single hand of blackjack. If you're unfamiliar with the rules:

each player will try to construct a hand of cards that's equal to 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over
the sum of the numeric values of the cards determine the value of a hand

face cards are worth 10

aces are worth 1 or 11

the player with the hand closest to (or equal to) 21 wins

ties are possible

each player is dealt 2 cards from a 52 card deck, with each card representing some numeric value
